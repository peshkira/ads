To run spread @localhost without having to rewrite the spread.conf to get rid of the IP errors run it with parmaters:
-n localhost

the config file should be enough for our purposes as stated in the user manual(page 9-10 and Fig2.1) - we have machines running in one network connected via router. Otherwise we needed public IP adresses of servers which we don't have.
